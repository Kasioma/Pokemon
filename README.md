# Gatchamon

Gatchamon 

First full stack application created by me, it is a gatcha game featuring pokemons from the popular franchise. This app was build using html, vanilla CSS, JavaScript, Node.js 

## Project Status
It is a prototype, majority of the features are somewhat completed, major issues you might encounter is CSS code being unpolished, I'm still inexperienced with handling general CSS designs. . .
Not all the monsters' stats have been added to the database, can be addressed later

## Reflection

Since highschool I was always captivated by the idea of web-developement but
until now I didn't have a good enough environment to get things done.

So as I've passed the first univesity year, I decided what I want to do with my life
and thus this idea was born. At first I took some HTML and CSS classes to get a better grasp
of what had to be done and after a long debate I've decided to create this first web-app of mine
using vanilla HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Context is "I want to try vanilla before entangling in librabies and whatnot".

Database used was postgres sql due to working with it at DataBases class and back-end was created using Node.js and express.
There are a lot of improvements that could be implemented on this project but I gave my best and consider this
a BIG first step in my future career!

The main topic of this app was chosen based on my personal preferences, as a veritable Pok√©mon fan I desperately wanted to
"start off with my favorites". I've learned a lot from this journey and I can't wait to get into more complex technologies.
