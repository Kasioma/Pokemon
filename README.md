## Gatchamon

Gatchamon 

First full stack application created by me, it is a gatcha game featuring pokemons from the popular franchise. This app was build using html, vanilla CSS, JavaScript, Node.js 

## Project Status
It is a prototype, majority of the features are somewhat completed, major issues you might encounter is CSS code being unpolished, I'm still inexperienced with handling general CSS designs. . .
Not all the monsters' stats have been added to the database, can be addressed later
